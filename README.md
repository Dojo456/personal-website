<h1>My Personal Website</h1><p>Most personal websites these days are sleek, modern, and minimalistic. I decided to stray from this a little and themed it after Windows 98. As an extra challenge, I decided to use <code>Jinja</code> and <code>Flask</code> instead of a <code>Javascript</code> frontend framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Demo</h1><p>You can view this website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://daniel-liao.com">https://daniel-liao.com</a>, you might even be reading this on my personal website!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>My Blog (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://daniel-liao.com/blog">https://daniel-liao.com/blog</a>)</h3><p>I post semi-regularly here about anything that comes up, I write my posts using a WYSIWYG editor built into the website:</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:1916/928;" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/personal-website-8f505.appspot.com/o/images%2FScreenshot%202024-11-06%20151303.png?alt=media&amp;token=aa95b681-e4a0-4f1b-910a-5f4073677c6a" width="1916" height="928"></figure><p>Internally, the HTML template for the blog endpoint is flexible to be used for any list of time-sorted rich-text content, and I can easily create blogs of different topics hosted at different endpoints.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>My GitHub Projects (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://daniel-liao.com/blog">https://daniel-liao.com/projects</a>)</h3><p>You can view all my public GitHub projects that have at least 1 star here. &nbsp;With each project, you can click on the <code>View More Info</code> button to view the README.md of that repo directly from the browser. An admin (me), can also edit the README.md directly from the browser and commit to GitHub on save:</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:1919/940;" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/personal-website-8f505.appspot.com/o/images%2FScreenshot%202024-11-06%20152147.png?alt=media&amp;token=34327bfa-c72d-4798-82fb-7ec10a3b5291" width="1919" height="940"></figure><h1>Learnings</h1><p>I've had a lot of experience building websites / webapps using JS frontend frameworks (React, SvelteKit, and Next.js), but I haven't really built one using “traditional” technologies such as HTML templates and a web server since I started learning programming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, I set out to built a complete webapp using these technologies. I got a better understanding of what the default behavior of HTML elements are, as opposed to just slapping <code>event.preventDefault()</code> on every callback. I also became far more familiar with HTML form design patterns such as <code>POST-REDIRECT-GET</code> and using hidden inputs, these are patterns that have become irrelevant with mostly client-side rendered apps using <code>AJAX</code>.</p>
